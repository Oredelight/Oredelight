### Hey there! <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9fcde363f6e46385fd7bc47ef8edd937acaa2c872216105ab0475369f1c1a005/68747470733a2f2f656d6f6a69732e736c61636b6d6f6a69732e636f6d2f656d6f6a69732f696d616765732f313533363335313037352f343539342f626c6f622d776176652e676966" width="30" />

I'm <a href="https://github.com/Oredelight">Oreee</a>, a backend developer.

I design and build whatever I can imagine, and I enjoy taking on new challenges and figuring things out through code.

The thought of taking on new challenges always excites me.

My main tech stack is **Python**, **Flask**, and **FastAPI**.

I’m steadily growing into a strong software engineer — learning, building, and improving with every project.

I’ve got a few pinned projects below, and my favorite one is <a href="https://github.com/Oredelight/Personal-Blog">Personal Blog</a>.

Currently working on some personal projects.


### Fun Facts:
- I love money — and yes, I believe it brings happiness.
- My favorite artist is **Jennie** (and I’m unapologetically loud about it)
- Coding used to scare me; now I can’t imagine a day without it
- **Hobbies**: reading,watching Tiktok, building things
